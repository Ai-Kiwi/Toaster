# PlateRates

Welcome to the official repository for PlateRates, a fun and engaging social media app centered around food. PlateRates was inspired by a joke about an app called Toaster Todo with toast, and it has since evolved through various stages to become an app where you can rate any food. You can find PlateRates at [platerates.com](https://platerates.com).

## What is PlateRates?

PlateRates is a lighthearted app designed for food enthusiasts to share and rate homemade dishes. Whether you're a culinary expert or just love to experiment in the kitchen, PlateRates is the perfect platform to showcase your creations and get feedback from the community. Unlike other food-related social media apps, PlateRates focuses on food made by users themselves, creating a more personal and fun experience.

## Features

- **Upload and Rate**: Share photos of your homemade dishes and receive ratings and feedback from other users.
- **Community Engagement**: Interact with a community of food lovers, exchange ideas, and discover new recipes.
- **Non-Serious Atmosphere**: PlateRates is all about having fun with food. It's not a serious food rating app but rather a place to enjoy and appreciate homemade dishes.

## Technologies Used

PlateRates was originally built with Node.js and JavaScript using Express and MongoDB for the backend, and Flutter for the frontend. It has since transitioned to Rust with SQLx, Axum, and PostgreSQL for the backend to ensure better performance and scalability.
